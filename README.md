Google Summer of Code 2021 Project: Improving Google Search on Buddhist Entities by Ingesting BDRC Database Into wikidata.org

Wikidata has proven to be the most efficient open source of knowledge having structured data which is extracted directly by google and affects the google search result directly. This data is then used to understand user search intent and to answer search queries directly as a Google Knowledge Graph Card. The Buddhist Digital Resource Center has a well-maintained database. The entities which already existed on Wikidata previously often lacked a name label in Tibetan. The project focused on adding missing as well as new entities with Tibetan, Chinese and English labels and aliases to wikidata from BDRC.

The goal of the project was to dramatically improve the usability of both Google and Wikidata for Tibetan natives and the community. With the results, we are sure that the contributions made throughout the project were very helpful as the results continue to improve over time.

Used Python + OpenRefine + QuickStatements during the project to import 16938 people entities and 5042 place entities, 41109 names and aliases, along with many entity relations and improved search result pages and discoverability of those entities.

The project proved to be a very enlightening and experience-filled process and will surely help me in the future. I would once again like to thank my mentors for believing in me and helping me throughout the project and making this summer program a successful one. I will surely cherish this great learning experience and I hope to keep contributing in the spirit of open knowledge for all.
